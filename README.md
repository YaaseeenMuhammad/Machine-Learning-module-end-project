# Machine-Learning-module-end-project

This repository contains a comprehensive end-to-end machine learning project focused on car price prediction using a real-world dataset. The notebook demonstrates the complete workflow of a regression problem, including:

    Data preprocessing and cleaning

    Handling outliers using the IQR method

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including correlation analysis

    Feature engineering with categorical encoding

    Splitting data into training and testing sets

    Feature scaling

    Training and evaluating multiple regression models:

        Linear Regression

        Decision Tree Regressor

        Random Forest Regressor

        Gradient Boosting Regressor

        Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

    Hyperparameter tuning of the Random Forest model using GridSearchCV

    Model performance evaluation and visualization

    Feature importance analysis

The goal is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates car prices based on various features such as horsepower, engine type, car dimensions, and brand.

This notebook is ideal for learners and practitioners who want to understand the full machine learning pipeline for regression problems and compare model performance effectively.
